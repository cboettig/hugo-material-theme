<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>You should be generally numerically literate, and some prior programming
experience will be helpful. Students new to programming might find
<a href="http://amzn.com/1449359019">Hands on Programming with R</a> to be helpful.
Students with significant experience in programming and statistical analysis
should find themselves well prepared but should find plenty still to learn
in each lesson.</p>

<h2 id="instructional-methods">Instructional Methods</h2>

<p>As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video
material that they are expected to view/read prior to class. Classes
will involve brief refreshers on new concepts followed by working on
exercises in class that cover that concept. While students are working on
exercises the instructor will actively engage with students to help them
understand material they find confusing, explain misunderstandings and
help identify mistakes that are preventing students from completing the
exercises, and discuss novel applications and alternative approaches to
the data analysis challenges students are attempting to solve. For more
challenging topics class may start with 20-30 minute demonstrations on
the concepts followed by time to work on exercises.</p>

<h2 id="assignment-policy">Assignment policy</h2>

<p>Data science is about analyzing real-world data sets, and so a series
of projects involving real data are a required part of the course. You
may work alone or with a single partner on all projects.</p>

<p>Assignments are due Monday night by 11:59 pm Pacific Time. Assignments
should be submitted as instructed.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Grades will be assigned using the following weighted components:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>component</th>
<th>weight</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Final Project</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>HW Exercises</td>
<td>60%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Participation</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Details of grading criteria will not usually be announced in advance. It is expected
that students in this course will have a wide range of prior experience
and ability, and grading will aim to reflect learning and effort in the course.
It is certainly possible for all students to receive high grades in this course
if all of you show mastery of the material and completely attempt all assignments.</p>

<h2 id="make-up-policy">Make-up policy</h2>

<p>Late assignments will be docked 20% and will not be accepted more than 48
hours late except in cases of genuine emergencies that can be documented
by the student or in cases where this has been discussed and approved in
advance. This policy is based on the idea that in order to learn how to
use computers well, students should be working with them at multiple times
each week. Time has been allotted in class for working on assignments and
students are expected to work on them outside of class. It is intended
that you should have finished as much of the assignment as you can based
on what we have covered in class by the following class period. Therefore,
even if something unexpected happens at the last minute you should already
be close to done with the assignment. This policy also allows rapid
feedback to be provided to students by returning assignments quickly.</p>

<h2 id="learning-cooperatively">Learning Cooperatively</h2>

<p>I encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your friends
and classmates as you are working on them. You will definitely learn more
in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions,
answer questions, and share ideas liberally. <strong>Please identify your
collaborators by name on all assignments</strong>.</p>

<p>Since you&rsquo;re working collaboratively, keep your project partner and the
course instructor informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes
you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop
the course for any reason, please don&rsquo;t just disappear silently! You
should inform your project partner, so that nobody is depending on you
to do something you can&rsquo;t finish.</p>

<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>Cooperation has a limit, however. You should not copy your code or
answers directly with other students. Feel free to discuss the problems
with others, but write your own solutions.  Penalties for cheating are
severe &ndash; they range from a zero grade for the assignment or exam up to
dismissal from the University, for a second offense.</p>

<p>Rather than copying someone else&rsquo;s work, ask for help. You are not alone
in this course! If you invest the time to learn the material and complete
the projects, you won&rsquo;t need to copy any answers.</p>

<h2 id="support">Support</h2>

<p>You are not alone in this course; your student colleagues and the
course instructor are here to support you as you learn the material. It&rsquo;s
expected that some aspects of the course will take time to master, and the
best way to master challenging material is to ask questions. Time will
be set aside in each class to ask questions and discuss the material.
You are encouraged to bring up related questions that arise in your
research as well.</p>

<p><strong>Office hours will be held by appointment.</strong></p>

<h2 id="quiz-exam-policy">Quiz/Exam Policy</h2>

<p>There are no quizzes or exams in this course.</p>

<h2 id="course-technology">Course Technology</h2>

<p>Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free
and open source software on those laptops.
Support will be provided by the instructor in the
installation of required software. If you donâ€™t have access to a
laptop please contact the instructor and they will do their best to
provide you with one.</p>

<h2 id="materials-resources">Materials &amp; Resources</h2>

<p>All reading material required for this course will be made available
through this website and links to related resources.</p>
